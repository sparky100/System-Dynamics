The **Camino de Santiago from Oviedo**, is the first section of the **Primitive Way.** This section, from Oviedo to Lugo, is ideal for those pilgrims who want to capture **the essence of the Primitive Way**.

The Camino Primitivo is the oldest route on the Camino de Santiago, used for the first time by devout pilgrims from Asturias in the 9th century, including **King Alfonso II**. The Primitive Way begins in the elegant city of Oviedo, where the **Cathedral of El Salvador** is located, an important pilgrimage point for many centuries.

We will walk through the Asturian mountains through forest trails, mountain passes with magnificent views and picturesque mountain villages. Undoubtedly, the views we will see during the **Primitive Way** compensate for the effort involved in walking it.

We will arrive to the city of Lugo, known for having one of the best preserved Roman walls in Europe, which extends for 2 km around the old town. The **Roman wall of Lugo is a World Heritage listed by UNESCO**. Lugo also stands out for its cuisine, the city has a large number of tapas bars.
